                Contributed to the level design of "Big Greasy" by:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Exploring player interactions with the world and creating engaging level layouts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implementing people and with text and voice outputs(I did the voice lines) within the game for the player to interact with.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring the level design supports and enhances the game's narrative and mechanics(there are random objects that the player can just pickup and throw through the world.).

                UI Developer
            </div>
            <div class="contribution-summary">
                Developed the user interface for "Big Greasy," focusing on:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Creating interactions between the player and the world using an interface that avoids constant updates in the `Update` function.
                    </li>
                    &nbsp;
                    Developing dynamic UI elements that provide information to the player about interactable objects.
                    </li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        The UI, I worked on for the Rat Race was probably the work I'm proud about because the interactions and working between the timer to function was a bit tricky.The organization of the was a bit tricky between having a UI Manager talk to the RaceTrack script that determines the when the races starts and who wins, and the RatMenu script that decreases money and decides how much money it gives the player.
